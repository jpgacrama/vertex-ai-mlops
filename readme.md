# Vertex AI for Machine Learning Operations

## ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mike

I want to share and enable [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform) from [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) with you.  The goal here is to share a comprehensive set of end-to-end workflows for machine learning that each cover the range of data to model to serving and managing - even automating the flow.  Regardless of your data type, skill level or framework preferences you will find something helpful here.

## Overview

This is a series of workflow demonstrations that use the same data source to build and deploy the same machine learning model with different frameworks and automation.  These are meant to help get started in understanding and learning Vertex AI and provide starting points for new projects.  

The demonstrations focus on workflows and don't delve into the specifics of ML frameworks other than how to integrate and automate with Vertex AI. Let me know if you have ideas for more workflows or details to include!

To understand the contents of this repository, the following charts uncover the groupings of the content.

## Vetex AI

Vetex AI is a platform for end-to-end model development.  It consist of core components that make the processes of MLOps possible for design patterns of all types.

## Interacting with Vertex AI
Many Vertex AI resources can be viewed and monitored directly in the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai).  Vertex AI resources are primarily created, and modified with the [Vertex AI API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference).  

The API is accessible from:
- the command line with [`gcloud ai`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/ai), 
- [REST](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest),
- [gRPC](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rpc), 
- or the [client libraries](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/client-libraries) (built on top of gRPC) for
    - [Python](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest), 
    - [Java](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/google-cloud-aiplatform/latest/overview), and 
    - [Node.js](https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest).  

The notebooks in this repository primarily use the Python client `aiplatform`.  There is occasional use of `aiplatform.gapic`,  `aiplatform_v1` and `aiplatform_v1beta1`.

For the full details on the APIs versions and layers and how/when to use each, [see this helpful note](./Tips/aiplatform_notes.md).

**Install the Vertex AI Python Client**
```python
pip install google-cloud-aiplatform
```

**Example Usage: Listing all Model in Vertex AI Model Registry**
```python
PROJECT = 'statmike-mlops-349915'
REGION = 'us-central1'

# List all models for project in region with: aiplatform
from google.cloud import aiplatform
aiplatform.init(project = PROJECT, location = REGION)

model_list = aiplatform.Model.list()
```

## Setup

The demonstrations are presented in a series of JupyterLab notebooks. These can be reviewed directly in [this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/statmike/vertex-ai-mlops) or cloned to your Jupyter instance on [Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/notebook-solution).

### Option 1: Review files directly

Select the files and review them directly in the browser or IDE of your choice.  This can be helpful for general understanding and selecting sections to copy/paste to your project.
